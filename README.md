# YLD Coding Challenge

This challenge was written in TypeScript for the NodeJs runtime:

```bash
$ node -v
v16.15.0
$ npm -v
8.5.5
```

## Installation

1. After downloading the source code:

```bash
$ cd yld-challenge
```

2. Install the web project dependencies and compile the source code:

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm run build
```

## Execution

To run the software:

```bash
$ npm start
```

By default the start script will execute the test files.

Those files should contain the execution rules and descriptions.

The tests can always be executed directly with `npm test`.
